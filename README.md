# Architecture and Justification
Based on the lecture slides, we already knew that the RecyclerView would place us between an MVC and MVVM architecture. 
We decided on an MVC architecture for our smaller scale project for a more direct/simple connection between model to view to controller, 
and we were less concerned about long-term testing of our project. 
From our code, the xml files and layouts operate as the view, the database and SharedPreferences storage operate as the model, and the controller
operates as the java classes linking the two and updating either view or model as needed.
